         <p> <i>Handball</i> <br><br>
             One of my most favourite thing over the years was playing handball. I started playing handball at the age of 11, and stopped at
             the age of 19. At the beggining i was playing it just fo fill my free time, but as the time went on, i realised that i really
             enjoyed playing it. Besides my team, i also played for my primary and secondary school team. Another great experince besides the
             handball matches, was several times gaving the role of referee.

            At the beggining, we weren't at any league, but at the age of 13 i entered the pioneers team and playing in State's East pioneer league.
            It was a whole new thing for me, as starting to play versus other teams, playing in other cities and hall's, playing in front of
            spectators and fans in some hall's. My first position was pivot, and for start i really found my self on that position and i enjoyed playing
            on it. As we started competing in the league, every winter we were going on 7 day's preseason trainings, mostly in Slovenia. At the age of 13 i
            also started playing for my primary school's handball team. I stayed in the pioneer's team until the age of 16, where we didn't get to the
            State's Easy Pioneere League Final4's.

            As i turned 16 i joined the cadets team and my new position was left wing, which remained until the end of my handball career.
            This also meant new experience for me because we started playing in front of fan's in our hall and in other's too. This brought
            more excitement in the matches, but also more pressure when we played away. The first season didn't went well as we planned,
            but in the 2017/2018 season we finally reached the State's Final4 where we ended with Bronze medal. Later on, at the age of 18
            i joined the senior's team where we faced all age player's and we felt the real handball means. When i started univesity i stopped
            playing handball, because i wanted to give my best and spend most of my time in the IT sector.

            Beside's my handball team obligation's, from 13year's i played for my primary and secondary school handball team. In ninth grade, we reached State's
            Final 4 where we ended 4th placeand in fourth year in secondary school where ended fifth place on state's level.

            Sometime's i got another role on the field, as referee. It was another great experience too. I got chance to jugde a match in pioneer and cadete team
            in my home town and in some other's. Beside's great experience it was also pleasure to feel how is it like to be handball referee.

            <i>Free Time Sport's</i> <br><br>
            Although my all time favourite sport was handball, some weekend's when i didn't have any school or handball activities, i spent my free time playing mostly
            basketball and football outside, while volleyball in PE class. I really enjoyed playing any kind of inside door sport, because it's great way to spend your time
            with your friend's but also good for your health. I also tried training football for 2-3months together with handball, but very soon i realised that handball is
            kind of sport that i would like to play and spend some real time on it. But whenever there was a great footbal match on TV, i never missed a chance to watch it.
            I also tried to watch some outdoor sport's like skiing, golf, swimming, hiking and other's too, but never found something fun in them, whether to watch them or try
            them.
