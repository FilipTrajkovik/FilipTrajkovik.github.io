        <p> Ⅰ Primary School<br><br>
            I've started my education in Vanco Prke school, Stip. My favourite subjects were IT, English and Math. In the IT class,
            we've been studying the basics about web, microsoft word, powerpoint and excel. In eight and ninth grade i was in
            IT competition, where i had to answer some questions about web and do some tasks in microsoft word, powerpoint and
            excel. After the IT competition, i knew that i would be styding something connected with IT and math. Because i played
            handball, i've also been playing every year with the handball school team.

        <p>ⅠⅠⅠ University<br><br>
            One of my smarter decision's in my life is that i decided was to be an IT student. I chose Software engineering and Information
            systems. I'm so happy that i can now learn and meet with real-life challenges, such as some programms, web pages making, finding
            solutions for all kind of problems. The univesity is well organised, where we can gather some real experience and be prepeared
            for the upcoming challenges further.

        <p>ⅠⅠ Secondary School<br><br>
            I continued my edutucation in the Gymnasiumin Stip. In second year i participated in IT competition, when we had to write
            3 assignment in C++ and one page with html. I found so much interesting those competetitions, because they were like introduction
            to how does IT Univesity work. As soon as i entered third year and Natural Sciences and Mathematics direction, i've come with my
            decision that i would like to study computer science. In my free time, i had a chance to visit a company and see what and how does programmer
            needs to do, which it only further increased my desire for computer science.
